My day has been good, I woke up and ate some breakfest then went with my brother to pick up his car. 
We talked on the way there and back, I told him about yesterday when my freaking laptop got crazy and shut me out..
Then I got back home and found Martin on teams, he had kindly offered to help me yesterday so we had a meeting were he
took me through what we worked on yesterday and it went great, now I am doing my homework!
